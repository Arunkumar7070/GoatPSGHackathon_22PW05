# Fleet Management System

## Overview

The Fleet Management System is a multi-robot coordination framework designed to efficiently navigate a structured environment. It prevents collisions using a reservation-based system, dynamically allocates tasks to robots, and ensures smooth traffic flow within a finite robot fleet.

## Features

- **Path Optimization** – Uses the A\* algorithm to compute the shortest paths.
- **Collision Avoidance** – Prevents head-on collisions with a lane reservation mechanism.
- **Dynamic Task Allocation** – Assigns and reallocates tasks in real-time.
- **Finite Robot Management** – Optimized for handling a limited number of robots.
- **Traffic Management** – Dynamically reserves lanes to prevent congestion and deadlocks.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** – A Tkinter-based visualization tool to monitor robot movements and traffic conditions.
- **Logging & Debugging** – Logs key events and robot activities for analysis and troubleshooting.
